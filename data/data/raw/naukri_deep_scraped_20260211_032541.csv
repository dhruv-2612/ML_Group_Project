We are a team of 60 hungry, ambitious & hard working individuals and are adding more people to the team who share our desire to leave a lasting impact on humanity.
What You ll Do
Drive Cross-Functional Performance: Act as the ""Product CEO"" for your domain; proactively hunting for friction in the user journey and engineering the connective tissue between Product, Sales, and Success.
Architect Agentic Systems: Design and deploy autonomous AI workflows (n8n, APIs, LLMs) that move beyond linear logic to automate reasoning-based tasks across Sales and Support.
Ship High-Fidelity Prototypes: Rapidly build and own internal tools or ""makeshift"" features using no-code stacks (Retool, Lovable) to unblock GTM teams and validate ideas before Engineering commits code.
Operationalize Product Intelligence: Bridge the gap between raw data and strategy by using SQL and LLMs to synthesize unstructured feedback into high-signal roadmap priorities.
Command Full-Cycle Rollouts: Own the ""last mile"" from technical QA and automated migrations to the enablement of CS and Sales ensuring every feature is commercially and operationally ready.
What we re looking for:
Required (Must-Have)

4 6+ years of experience in Product Management, Product Ops, or Growth at a fast-growing B2B SaaS company.

Technical Background: Ability to read/write basic JavaScript or Python for API debugging and custom logic within no-code tools.

Good to have

Non-Deterministic QA: In an LLM world, features dont just ""work"" or ""break"" they hallucinate. You must have experience building

Cost & Latency Management: Ability to make trade-offs between model power (e.g., GPT-4o) and efficiency (e.g., GPT-4o-mini/Claude Haiku) based on the business value of the use case.
Agentic Frameworks: Hands-on experience or deep familiarity with orchestrating LLM agents (e.g., using LangChain, CrewAI, or n8n s AI nodes) to perform multi-step, non-linear tasks.
What you ll get:
Competitive base salary + performance-based bonus.
Meaningful equity you ll be an early partner in our growth.
Work directly with both the founders. No layers at all at this point.
